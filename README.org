* Configs

  Initialation and configuration codes are placed in functions
  =dotspacemacs/user-init= and =dotspacemacs/user-config=.

  Though, if the configs are complicate, it is advised to group them
  into a folder under =configs/= directory with initialization codes in
  =init.el= and configuration codes in =config.el=. They would be loaded
  in the functions =dotspacemacs/user-init= and =dotspacemacs/user-config=
  respectively.
